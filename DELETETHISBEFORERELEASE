Design notes.

As this game is supposed to be a tool to make specific ppl be scared,
here we simply have scary mobs.
Mobs:
- Directly moving through everything. I need to add digging sounds. Generally, rather bad attempt.
- A* bot with rockets, hands to dig, inventory to place nodes, execute animations.
  It sometimes stands at distance and if player and it look at each other then it very quickly jumps to quickly kill.
  It can jump at roof where player is, if is chasing and can't reach.
  It can dig towards player that made noises nearby.
- TODO Not scary jumping images for first part of game.
- TODO Little friendly bot that introduce to game
- TODO Slime bot that also can fly and penetrate objects, but is harder to kill and has other attack.
  Generally, less aggressive.
- TODO Vehicle bot
- TODO Jet bot
- TODO Worm bot
- TODO Another A* bot

This game is supposed to have scary sounds, animations, gradually increase danger, so mobs should evolve.

Palette is grayscale for simplicity.
